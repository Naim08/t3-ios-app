description: Master the Edit-Test Loop
---

This is TDD but with an AI doing the implementation:

Ask AI to write a failing test that captures exactly what you want
Review the test yourself - make sure it tests the right behavior
Then tell the AI: "Make this test pass"
Let the AI iterate - it can run tests and fix failures automatically
The key is reviewing the test before implementation. A bad test will lead to code that passes the wrong requirements.
